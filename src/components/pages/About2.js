            Picturing Mexican America is a cluster of digital humanities projects designed and run by Professor Marissa L0pez of UCLA. We are 
            committed to illuminating the long, Mexican history of Los Angeles that's been systemically erased through centuries of white, cultural
            supremacy. At PMA's core is a mobiel app in current development being built in collaboration with the Los Angeles Public Library, that will
            display image of 19th century, Mexican Los Angeles to users based on their location. PMA is a research and teaching hub open to partnerships
            with local organizations.
